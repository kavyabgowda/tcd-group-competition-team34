# Income-Prediction-ML-Group Project -Repo -Team 34

This Project demonstrates solving Income Predictions for datasets available in "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tcdml1920-income-ind/data". Various methodologies are followed in this project to clean the data, process the data and fit the data to the best available model to get the error rate of 67k. The problem statement for this project is available at "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tcdml1920-income-ind/overview".

## Methodologies to be followed in using project:
Required Dependencies:
1.	IDE to run the python code(Ex. Spyder)
2.	Install below mentioned dependent packages using PIP installer.

```bash
lightgbm, pandas, sklearn 
```
3. Execute Final_Submission_File_Random_Forest.py in Python Console.

4. This code fit the data to RandomForestRegressor model. If required change the model to other Regressor model and check the accuracy of model.

5. Check the accuracy of model by executing Accuracy section of the code.
